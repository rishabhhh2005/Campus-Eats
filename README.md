## 🧠 System Architecture

Campus Eats follows a structured full-stack architecture:

- The frontend handles UI rendering and manages user interactions.
- The backend processes business logic, authentication, and API requests.
- MongoDB stores user data, menu details, and order records.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional campus food ordering systems rely on manual queues and offline order management, which often leads to:

- Long waiting times
- Order mismanagement
- Poor peak-hour handling
- Lack of order tracking

Campus Eats addresses these issues by digitizing the entire ordering workflow and improving operational efficiency.

🔐 API Architecture

The backend follows RESTful API principles:

GET → Fetch menu and order data

POST → Create new users and orders

PUT → Update order status

DELETE → Remove cart items (if implemented)

This ensures scalable and maintainable backend structure.
